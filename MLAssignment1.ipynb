    "Q1:1) Artificial Intelligence (AI):\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence is a broad field of computer science that focuses on creating machines, systems, or software that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, making decisions, solving problems, and learning from data. AI can be divided into two main categories: narrow AI (or weak AI), which is designed to perform specific tasks, and general AI (or strong AI), which aims to replicate human-like intelligence across a wide range of tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: One of the classic examples of AI is a virtual personal assistant, like Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, or Google Assistant. These AI-powered assistants can understand and respond to natural language commands, answer questions, set reminders, control smart home devices, and perform various tasks based on user input. They use natural language processing and machine learning to improve their ability to understand and respond to user requests over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Machine Learning (ML):\n",
    "Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. Instead of relying on hard-coded rules, machine learning algorithms use data to improve their performance over time. ML algorithms can be categorized into three types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A common example of machine learning is email spam filtering. In this case, a machine learning model is trained on a dataset of emails, with each email labeled as either \"spam\" or \"not spam.\" The model learns patterns and features from these labeled examples to classify incoming emails as spam or not. As more data is processed, the model becomes better at identifying and filtering out spam emails, making it more effective in reducing unwanted email clutter.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Deep Learning:\n",
    "Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that focuses on artificial neural networks inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. Deep Learning involves training neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks) to extract hierarchical representations of data. These networks can automatically discover and learn complex features from raw data, making them especially effective for tasks like image and speech recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Deep learning has been highly successful in computer vision applications, such as image recognition. For instance, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a type of deep learning model, have been used to build systems that can identify objects in images and even classify them. A famous example is the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge, where deep learning models have achieved human-level or better performance in classifying objects within images, showing the power of deep learning in image analysis.\n",
