    "A1. MongoDB is a document-oriented database that stores data in JSON-like format. It is a type of non-relational database, which means that it does not use tables, rows, and columns to organize data. Instead, it uses collections and documents, where each document can have a different structure and fields. Non-relational databases are also known as NoSQL databases, which stands for Not Only SQL. They are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, such as text, images, videos, social media posts, etc. They are also more flexible and scalable than relational databases, which require a fixed schema and predefined relationships between data entities. Some scenarios where MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When the data is heterogeneous and does not fit into a rigid schema.\n",
    "- When the data is dynamic and changes frequently over time.\n",
    "- When the data needs to be distributed across multiple servers or regions for high availability and performance.\n",
    "- When the data needs to support complex queries and aggregations that involve multiple fields and operators.\n",

    "A2. Some of the features of MongoDB are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Document Model: MongoDB stores data in BSON documents, which are binary-encoded JSON objects. Documents can have different fields and types, and can also contain arrays and nested subdocuments. This allows for a flexible and expressive data model that matches the way developers think and code.\n",
    "- Indexing: MongoDB supports indexing on any field in a document, including fields in arrays and subdocuments. Indexes improve the performance of queries by reducing the number of documents that need to be scanned. MongoDB also supports text indexes for full-text search, geospatial indexes for location-based queries, and compound indexes for sorting and filtering on multiple fields.\n",
    "- Sharding: MongoDB supports horizontal scaling by partitioning data across multiple servers or shards. Each shard holds a subset of the data based on a shard key, which determines how the data is distributed. Sharding enables MongoDB to handle large amounts of data and high throughput operations without compromising performance or availability.\n",
    "- Replication: MongoDB supports high availability by replicating data across multiple servers or replica set members. Each replica set has one primary member that receives all write operations, and one or more secondary members that apply the operations from the primary. If the primary fails, one of the secondaries is elected as the new primary automatically. Replication also allows for read scalability and data redundancy.\n",
    "- Aggregation: MongoDB provides a powerful aggregation framework that allows for complex data analysis and transformation. The aggregation framework consists of a pipeline of stages that process documents in sequence. Each stage can filter, group, sort, project, join, or modify the documents as they pass through. The aggregation framework supports various operators and expressions, including arithmetic, logical, string, array, date, conditional, and accumulator functions.\n",
    "- MapReduce: MongoDB also supports MapReduce, which is a programming model for processing large datasets in parallel. MapReduce consists of two phases: map and reduce. The map phase applies a function to each document in a collection and emits key-value pairs. The reduce phase applies another function to all the values associated with the same key and combines them into a single value. MapReduce can be used for tasks such as counting, grouping, filtering, or aggregating data.\n"
