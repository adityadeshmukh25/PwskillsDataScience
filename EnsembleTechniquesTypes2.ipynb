    "Q1. Bagging reduces overfitting in decision trees by training multiple trees on different bootstrap samples of the original dataset. Each tree sees a slightly different subset of the data, which introduces diversity among the trees. When making predictions, bagging aggregates the predictions from all trees, which helps to reduce the variance of the model, thus reducing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Advantages and disadvantages of using different types of base learners in bagging:\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "- Using diverse base learners can increase the diversity of the ensemble, which often leads to better generalization.\n",
    "- Different types of base learners may capture different aspects of the data, improving the overall predictive performance of the ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "- Combining highly diverse base learners might increase computational complexity and training time.\n",
    "- If the base learners are too similar, the ensemble might not benefit much from bagging, leading to minimal improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. The choice of base learner affects the bias-variance tradeoff in bagging. Using a high-variance base learner, such as a decision tree with no pruning, can reduce bias but increase variance. Bagging reduces variance by averaging the predictions of multiple models, which helps to mitigate overfitting caused by high-variance base learners. However, if the base learner is already low-bias, adding more models might not significantly improve the bias-variance tradeoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Yes, bagging can be used for both classification and regression tasks.\n",
    "   - For classification tasks, bagging typically aggregates the predictions of base classifiers using voting or averaging to make the final prediction.\n",
    "   - For regression tasks, bagging averages the predictions of base regression models to obtain the final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. The ensemble size in bagging refers to the number of base learners included in the ensemble. Generally, increasing the ensemble size improves the stability and robustness of the predictions. However, there is a point of diminishing returns where adding more models does not lead to significant improvement in performance but increases computational costs. The optimal ensemble size depends on factors such as the complexity of the problem, the diversity of base learners, and computational resources available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Real-world application of bagging in machine learning:\n",
    "   - One example is in finance for credit risk assessment. Bagging can be used to combine the predictions of multiple models trained on different subsets of financial data to predict the creditworthiness of individuals or companies. By aggregating the predictions, the model can make more accurate and robust decisions regarding loan approvals or credit risk assessments."
