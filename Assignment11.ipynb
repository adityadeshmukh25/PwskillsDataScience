For example, to create a process, we can use the multiprocessing.Process class and pass a target function and optional arguments. To start a process, we can use the start() method of the process object. To wait for a process to finish, we can use the join() method"

    "Q.2)The differences between multiprocessing and multithreading are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiprocessing is a technique that allows multiple processes to run concurrently in a single program. A process is an instance of a program that has its own memory space, code, and resources¹². Multithreading is a technique that allows multiple threads to run concurrently in a single process. A thread is a sequence of instructions that can be executed independently of other code¹².\n",
    "- Multiprocessing improves the performance and scalability of an application by utilizing the available CPU cores and reducing the waiting time for I/O operations¹². Multithreading improves the performance and responsiveness of an application by utilizing the available CPU resources more efficiently and reducing the overhead of creating and managing processes¹².\n",
    "- Multiprocessing can handle intensive computation, parallel processing, or concurrent execution of tasks¹²³. Multithreading can handle user input, computations, and display updates¹².\n",
    "- Multiprocessing requires more memory and resources than multithreading, as each process has its own address space and resources¹². Multithreading requires less memory and resources than multiprocessing, as threads share the same address space and resources of the process¹².\n",
    "- Multiprocessing avoids the global interpreter lock (GIL) issue in Python, as each process has its own interpreter and can run independently¹². Multithreading suffers from the GIL issue in Python, as only one thread can execute Python code at a time due to the GIL¹².\n",
    "- Multiprocessing is more prone to communication and synchronization issues than multithreading, as processes need to use inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms such as queues, pipes, or shared memory to exchange data¹². Multithreading is less prone to communication and synchronization issues than multiprocessing, as threads can use thread-specific data, locks, semaphores, or events to exchange data."
