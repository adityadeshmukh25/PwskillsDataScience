    "### Q1. Difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding\n",
    "- **Label Encoding:** It's a method where each unique category in a column is assigned a different integer number. For instance, in a \"Size\" column: small = 0, medium = 1, large = 2.\n",
    "- **Ordinal Encoding:** Similar to Label Encoding, but here, the categories are assigned values based on the order or rank among the categories. For example, low = 0, medium = 1, high = 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** For a column representing T-shirt sizes, if there is no inherent order, Label Encoding can be used. But if there's an order (like XS < S < M < L < XL), then Ordinal Encoding would be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. Target Guided Ordinal Encoding\n",
    "- **Target Guided Ordinal Encoding:** This method involves encoding categorical variables based on the target variable's mean or some statistical measure for each category. It can help create ordinal relationships in categorical data based on their relationship with the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** In a dataset with \"Education Level\" as a categorical feature, encoding it based on the average salary associated with each education level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. Covariance\n",
    "- **Covariance:** It's a measure of how much two random variables change together. It indicates the direction of the linear relationship between variables.\n",
    "- **Importance:** Covariance helps understand the relationship between variables in a dataset. A positive covariance suggests that as one variable increases, the other also tends to increase, while a negative covariance implies an inverse relationship. However, covariance doesn't provide the strength of the relationship."
