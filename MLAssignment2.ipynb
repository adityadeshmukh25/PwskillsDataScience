    "Q1: Overfitting and underfitting are common issues in machine learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Overfitting: This occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise and random variations rather than the underlying patterns. The consequences of overfitting are poor generalization to new, unseen data, leading to high test error. It's like memorizing answers for a test rather than understanding the material.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Underfitting: Underfitting happens when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data. This results in high training and test errors, as the model cannot even represent the training data properly.\n",

    "To mitigate overfitting and underfitting, you can use techniques like cross-validation, adjusting model complexity, feature selection, and regularization.\n",

    "Q4: The bias-variance tradeoff is a fundamental concept in machine learning. It refers to the tradeoff between a model's ability to fit the training data (low bias) and its ability to generalize to new, unseen data (low variance). High bias models are too simple and tend to underfit, while high variance models are too complex and tend to overfit. Finding the right balance between bias and variance is essential for optimal model performance.\n"
