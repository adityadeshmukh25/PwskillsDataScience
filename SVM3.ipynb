    "Q1. The best regression metric to employ when predicting house prices based on several characteristics such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, etc., would be Mean Squared Error (MSE). MSE is commonly used in regression tasks to measure the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. If your goal is to predict the actual price of a house as accurately as possible, using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as your evaluation metric would be more appropriate. MSE directly penalizes larger errors more heavily due to the squaring of the differences between predicted and actual values. Therefore, minimizing MSE would lead to a model that predicts house prices with higher accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. In a scenario with a significant number of outliers in the dataset, an appropriate regression metric to use with your SVM model would be Mean Absolute Error (MAE). MAE is less sensitive to outliers compared to MSE because it measures the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values. This makes MAE more robust in the presence of outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. If both Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values are very close after building an SVM regression model using a polynomial kernel, it's generally preferable to choose RMSE as the evaluation metric. RMSE is the square root of MSE and provides a more interpretable measure of the average prediction error in the same units as the target variable. This can help in better understanding the magnitude of prediction errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. When comparing the performance of different SVM regression models using different kernels (linear, polynomial, and RBF), an appropriate evaluation metric to measure how well the model explains the variance in the target variable is R-squared (R^2). R-squared represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. A higher R-squared value indicates that the model explains more variance and therefore performs better in terms of capturing the relationship between the predictors and the target variable."
