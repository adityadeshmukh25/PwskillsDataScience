    "A1. An API, or application programming interface, is a set of defined rules that enable different applications to communicate with each other. It acts as an intermediary layer that processes data transfers between systems, letting companies open their application data and functionality to external third-party developers, business partners, and internal departments within their companies¹. An example of an API in real life is the Google Maps API, which allows developers to embed Google Maps on web pages and mobile apps. The Google Maps API provides various methods and parameters to customize the map display and functionality, such as zoom level, markers, directions, etc.\n"

    "\n",
    "- They simplify software development and innovation by enabling applications to exchange data and functionality easily and securely.\n",
    "- They improve collaboration by allowing different platforms and apps to seamlessly communicate with each other.\n",
    "- They accelerate innovation by offering flexibility and scalability to connect with new business partners, offer new services, and access new markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some disadvantages of using APIs are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They can introduce security risks if not properly designed, implemented, and maintained. Hackers can exploit vulnerabilities in APIs to access sensitive data or disrupt services.\n",
    "- They can increase complexity and dependency if not well documented, tested, and monitored. Developers may face challenges in understanding, integrating, and troubleshooting APIs from different sources or versions.\n",
    "- They can incur costs and overhead if not efficiently managed and optimized. Organizations may need to invest in API management tools and platforms to ensure quality, performance, and compliance of their APIs."

    "A3. A Web API is an application programming interface for the Web. It is a type of API that uses web protocols and formats, such as HTTP, JSON, XML, etc., to communicate with web servers or browsers². A Web API can be either a browser API or a server API. A browser API can extend the functionality of a web browser by accessing its features or resources, such as geolocation, local storage, audio/video playback, etc. A server API can extend the functionality of a web server by exposing its data or services to external applications or users². A Web API differs from a regular API in that it is specifically designed for web-based interactions and follows web standards and best practices.\n"

    "\n",
    "REST is an architectural style that defines a set of principles and constraints for creating stateless, scalable, cacheable, and uniform web services. REST uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to perform operations on resources identified by URIs. REST uses various formats (JSON, XML, HTML, etc.) to exchange data between the client and the server³.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP is a protocol that defines a standard format for exchanging structured messages between the client and the server. SOAP uses XML as the message format and HTTP as the transport protocol. SOAP also defines a set of rules for describing the messages (using WSDL) and validating them (using XML Schema)⁴.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some shortcomings of SOAP are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is more complex and verbose than REST, requiring more bandwidth and processing power.\n",
    "- It is less flexible and interoperable than REST, requiring strict adherence to predefined schemas and standards.\n",
    "- It is less compatible with web browsers than REST, requiring additional libraries or frameworks to handle SOAP messages.\n"
