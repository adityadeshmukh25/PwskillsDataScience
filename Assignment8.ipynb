    "An exception in Python is an event that occurs when something goes wrong in the code, and disrupts the normal flow of execution. Exceptions are different from syntax errors, which are mistakes in the code that prevent the program from running. For example, a syntax error would be writing prin instead of print, while an exception would be trying to divide a number by zero, which is not allowed in mathematics.\n"

This will cause the program to stop and display a traceback message, which shows the type of exception, the line of code where it occurred, and the call stack. The program will not continue to run after the exception, unless it is caught by a higher-level function or module."
